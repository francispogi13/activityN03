   <h1>Life of a grade school student is different from the life of a college student.</h1>
 As a first year college student, it is so hard to adjust.
  It is so hard to catch up what is going through.
   life humbled me,to the point I looked down upon myself.
    I came up with the idea that maybe college is not for me, but what I did is I continue and pursue..
     I can define myself as a dedicated person, a person who's willing and eager to acquire new knowledge.
      I am a student who's compassionate in achieving my goals in life.
       I am a person who's motivated to achieve specific aspirations in life.
       <h1>As a student,</h1> actually I really do not know who I am. 
        All I know I am a student with purpose, worth, and value.
        I choose information technology because I love playing computer since I am 9 years old. 
        Thats why I choose this course and I believe my self,what if I try? there's no wrong to try,
        If somebody can do this,well I can do this too.
        If this course will work on me them I will continue this field.
<h1>And also I want to enchance my analytical skills,</h1>I want to learn coding and programming.
Every moment no matter how struggle and hard that I encounter, 
I would still be genuine and wise as well despite the hardest battles that I experience.
 And there are many opportunities what ever you want to apply.</h1>
